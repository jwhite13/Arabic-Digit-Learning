# Arabic-Digit-Learning
This is a repository containing work I conducted for a class final project. 
The purpose of this project was analyze sound recordings of numbers being spoken in Arabic
in order to perform voice recognition and clasify the numbers spoken using deep learning techniques.
There are several different models here, but the CNN and RNN are the most effective.
